+Code the following app
+```
+The goal is to create a digital decision tool, called Hash Cast, designed to feel like a futuristic, high-tech device with a dark screen and glowing neon accents. This tool helps users make a fair choice between 3 to 6 things they type in (like "Go to the movies," "Read a book," or "Cook dinner"). When the user presses the main "Roll" button, the app immediately generates a completely random, unique digital code, which acts like an untouchable source of truth. The app uses this code to mathematically determine the winner among the options, proving the choice was 100% fair and unbiased. The final screen must clearly show the winning option and display the secret digital code as Proof of Fairness. Furthermore, the app must have a History feature that permanently records every decision ever made—showing the winner and the unique code used—in a publicly accessible database so that the fairness of any past choice can be reviewed by anyone.
